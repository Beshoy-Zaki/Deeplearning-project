# Project: Deep Learning Implementation

## Overview

This repository, **Deeplearning-project**, contains a Jupyter Notebook that summarizes and implements concepts from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*. The notebook includes theoretical insights and a deep learning project based on the book's methodologies.

## Contents

- **Summary of the book section**: Key takeaways and explanations from the relevant chapters.
- **Deep Learning Project**: Application of deep learning techniques to a real-world dataset.
- **Code Implementation**: Step-by-step execution of deep learning models using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy
- Pandas

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Beshoy-Zaki/Deeplearning-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Deeplearning-project
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SemiColonGradProj.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells to execute the code and understand the implementations.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras jupyter
